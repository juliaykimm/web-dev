        <p>A moment that really resonated with me was when he had the viewer stare at a painting with no sound or movement. It made me realize that although the painting itself is important, the aura it gives off and the environment it is placed in is just as important to the way a viewer may look at it. I also enjoyed when he zoomed in on certain parts of paintings to show how crucial all other details are in forming a one frame story.</p>
        <p>Another monet which I found interesting was when he was dicussing a painting with children. I never realized this but I agree with him when he explains how, because children are so creative and are able to make stpries in their mind with very little, they may find something in a piece of art which adults cannot see. I thought this to be very thought provoking</p>
        <p>Over all, I enjoyed wathcing this episode, it brought up many cool and deep points which I usually would not be able to think about myself.</p>
